# Project Name
eyeMovement

## Description & General Info 
This project creates shapes that resemble a pair of eyes that move with the movement of the mouse on the DOM.

## Languages & Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup & Use
1. Download or clone the three files onto your local machine. Make sure that all files are saved in the same location. 
2. Load the HTML file onto your broswer, either by dragging & dropping the file or right-clicking on the file to specify where to open it. 
3. Move your mouse around the page to see the "eyes" match the direction of your mouse. 

## Suggestions for Improvement
- The "eyes" are currently set up with CSS to only have pupils, so a future improvement could be adding an additional shape in the code to make the "eyes" appear to have irises.
