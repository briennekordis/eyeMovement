# Project Title
Eye Movement

## Description
This project uses JavaScript and CSS to create shapes that resemble a pair of eyes that move with the movement of the mouse on the DOM.

## How to Use
Download or clone the three files onto your local machine. Make sure that all files are saved in the same location. Load the HTML file onto your broswer. 
Move your mouse around the page to see the "eyes" match the direction of your mouse. 

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
The "eyes" are currently set up with CSS to only have pupils, so a future improvement could be adding an additional shape in the code to make the "eyes" appear to have irises. 

## Licensing Information 
This code was produced by and for the MITxPro's Full Stack Developer Course.
